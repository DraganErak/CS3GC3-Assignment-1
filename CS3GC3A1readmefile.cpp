//Either click 1,2,3 or make it Dot, Line, Polygon mode respectively.

	//For Dot mode, click once to draw point, click again to move the point.
	//Do this for each point.
	
	//For Line mode, click once to determine point, click again to determine movement.
	//Click a 3rd time to have line drawn and first point moving. Click a 4th time to
	//make the 2nd point move. 
	//Do this for every line.
	
	//For the polygons, I was not able to make it go into seperate polygons.
	//So it will go the first click will make the first point.
	//The second click will determine the direction vector and determine it the 
	//first point's movement. The third click will make the second point.
	//The fourth click will determine the direction vector and determine it the 
	//third point's movement. The fifth click will draw those 3 points and
	//have the first 2 moving. The next click will determine the direction	
	//vector for the fifth click and move it. The next (odd)click and every other
	//click will draw points and extend them from the polygon, The next (even)click 
	//will determine the direction vector for the previous click's point and move it.
	
	
//Or you can do all the clicking you want while the screen is blank, then click 1,2,3 for 
//Dot, Line, Polygon mode respectively. Then the points/lines/polygon you have made will 
//appear instantly.


//Click "+" to speed up and "-" to speed down.

//Click "r" to reset the list of all shapes to a blank scene. 

//Click "p" to pause the animation. This will make the program crash because I was not able
	//to unpause the animation.
